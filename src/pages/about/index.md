### Our story – Kate Coleridge, Tanya Lund and Hadleigh & Co.

After having our children, we both decided not to return to corporate life and to use our combined marketing and business development experience of more than 20 years to help start-ups and small to medium sized businesses to grow. And so, Hadleigh & Co was formed early 2018.

We have spent much of our careers marketing professional corporate companies, both in Australia and the United Kingdom. Alongside this we are both fully qualified as marketing professionals and are passionate about what we do.

We have always loved marketing and before starting Hadleigh & Co we both felt there was more we could do with what we had learned throughout our diverse careers to help others. We had a strong belief that in starting our own business it would give us an opportunity to share our passion for marketing and to collaboratively work with businesses to achieve value out of their marketing budgets while empowering them to meet the needs of their business and clients.

### Why choose us

Whether you need a strategic marketing review, creation of a new marketing plan, an outsourced marketing function or assistance in undertaking a specific marketing project, Hadleigh & Co will take the time to get to know you and your business. To understand the passion, vision and drive behind your business – and the challenges of marketing in a competitive environment. For us, being part of a business’s journey to success is one of the greatest rewards.

After our strategic marketing planning workshop, I was able to see my business from a new perspective. Your marketing action plan and direction is easy executable for a lay-person like myself to follow.
